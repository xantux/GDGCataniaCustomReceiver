# GDGCataniaCustomReceiver
This is a demo receiver app for **Chromecast**, which I showed with **Emanuele Accardo** at the bootcamp event **"Google Cast with Nexus Player &amp; Android TV"**, organized by **GDG Catania** in June 2015, in the presence of **Google** and **Intel** employees. 
I would like to thank the GDG Catania manager **Fabio Arceri** for this opportunity.
