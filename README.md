This is a demo receiver app for **Chromecast**, which I showed with **Emanuele Accardo** at the bootcamp event **"Google Cast with Nexus Player &amp; Android TV"**, organized by [GDG Catania](https://www.facebook.com/gdgcatania/) in June 2015, in the presence of **Google** and **Intel** employees.

I would like to thank the GDG Catania manager **Fabio Arceri** for this opportunity.
